## üîë Techniques Covered

1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   A substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number of positions.
   
2. **Playfair Cipher**  
   A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 grid for encryption.

3. **Vigen√®re Cipher**  
   A polyalphabetic cipher using a repeating keyword to encrypt text.

4. **Affine Cipher**  
   A combination of linear transformations for character substitution.

5. **Transposition Ciphers**  
   Rearranges plaintext characters according to a specific pattern.

6. **One-Time Pad**  
   A theoretically unbreakable cipher using a random key as long as the plaintext.
